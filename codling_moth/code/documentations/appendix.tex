\section{Appendix}
The list below corresponds to folder names for historical data and six future climate projections. Each of the``future'' folders will have two folders rcp45 and rcp85.\\

 
\hspace{-.2in}{\scriptsize {\code{categories = c("historical", "BNU-ESM", "CanESM2", "GFDL-ESM2G", "bcc-csm1-1-m", "CNRM-CM5", "GFDL-ESM2M")}}}\\

The raw data (file name: \vari{data\_lat\_long}) for 
the 295 locations that are currently part of the web 
app are in the first path below (folder names in list above). 
 These are the input data folders you will need 
 to reproduce rds files and plots.  The second 
 path below contains historical input data for 
 a larger set of locations which we processed 
 to find historical analogs. You will need it later, 
 but not now to reproduce results in web app.
