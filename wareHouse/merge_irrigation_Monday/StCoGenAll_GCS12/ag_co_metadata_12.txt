  Description:
    Abstract:
      The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Agricultural
      Statistics Service (NASS) conducted an Agricultural Census in 2012.  The
      statistical census data are summarized at the county, state, and U.S. levels
      and are available in a digital format.  The Research and Development Division
      of NASS modified generalized county boundaries to show geographic areas for
      which the 2012 Agricultural Census statistics are reported at the county
      level.  These county-level boundary files were used in the production of
      the 2012 Census of Agriculture, thematic census maps of the United States.
      The boundary files can be employed in a Geographic Information System (GIS)
      with the 2012 Agricultural Census statistical data by using the Agricultural
      Census county codes to associate the county-level spatial entities with the
      county-level statistical data.
    Purpose:
      The boundaries are intended for geographic display and analysis at the county-
      level.  The boundary data are designed for small scale thematic mapping
      applications at a scale of 1:20,000,000 or smaller (e.g., 1:50,000,000, etc.).
      The county-level boundaries are provided "as is".  The USDA/NASS does not
      warrant the results you may obtain using the Agricultural Census county-level
      boundary data.
    Supplemental_Information:
      These Agricultural Census county-level boundary files may be used with statistical
      data in the 2012 Census of Agriculture, Volume 1, Geographic Area Series,
      Parts 1 - 50, 52.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      Unmodified entities have entity codes and names which conform to
      the American National Standards Institute, INCITS 31:200x, formerly
      Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 6-4.  Area values in
      square miles are derived from land polygon area values from the
      U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: No topological checks were performed on the data.
  Completeness_Report:
    The generalized data do NOT include 1) boundaries for the Aleutian
    Islands in the Eastern Hemisphere, 2) boundaries for Hawaiian Islands
    west of -160.555771 degrees longitude, 3) very small polygons because of
    coordinate thinning, and 4) water polygons.  This data set provides the
    land area in square miles and in acres for each county equivalent (or
    agricultural census area in Alaska).  The land area values are based on
    the area of land polygons from the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER database.
    If a county is composed of several polygons, the area value assigned to
    each polygon is the land area value of the entire county (for the purpose
    of choropleth mapping).  Some of the county-level boundaries were modified
    to show geographic areas for which Agricultural Census statistics are
    reported.  County Federal Information Processing (FIPS) codes for the
    modified counties were replaced by Agricultural Census county codes.  States
    with modifications to their county boundaries and county codes are - Alaska,
    Hawaii, Maryland, Missouri, Virginia (and the District of Columbia).
  Positional_Accuracy:
    Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy:
      Horizontal_Positional_Accuracy_Report:
        The county-level boundary data are highly generalized and suitable
        for use in small scale (1:20,000,000) thematic mapping applications.
        No accuracy tests were performed.

        The county-level boundaries show geographic areas for which 2012
        Agricultural Census statistics are reported.  Certain individual
        counties were assigned the FIPS code of a designated adjacent or
        surrounding county.  The following is a list of counties with
        modified boundaries.  The Agricultural Census county codes and
