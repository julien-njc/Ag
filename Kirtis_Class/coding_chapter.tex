\begin{rem}
Refrain from copying your code from
one file to another.
\end{rem}
\noindent When you copy your code from one file/module
to another that means you use it a lot. Thus, you can
save it in a unique module and call it again and again.
This is easier, faster, and more importantly sustainable.
For example, if you plot a vector with your favorite settings,
write a function once then use it. If later you need
to change the font, for example, to be consistent with
the journal you want to submit your paper to, then, you can
change the font only once. Otherwise, you have to go to
all the files you wrote before and change them one at a time!
Just stop copy/pasting.
